# Genotype data from the Gandhi, et al. experiment ending March 13, 2013## The experiment was performed in a 96 well plate with zebrafish# embryos.  Gene sequencing was later used to identify the genotype# of the fish in each well.  Not all fish could be genotyped.## The mutants being studied have deletions in the gene coding for# arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase (aanat), which is a key enzyme# in the rhythmic production of melatonin.  Melatonin is a hormone# responsible for regulation of circadian rhythms.  It is often taken# as a drug to treat sleep disorders.  The goal of this study is to# investigate the effects of aanat deletion on sleep pattern in# 5+ day old zebrafish larvae.## Each column lists the wells corresponding to the genotype of# each fish.  If a number is missing (between 1 and 96), the # genotype of that fish is not known.# # These data were kindly provided by Avni Gandhi and Audrey Chen# from David Prober's lab.## THESE DATA ARE NOT PUBLISHED AND ARE NOT TO BE SHARED WITH ANYONE# OUTSIDE OF BE/BI 103!!Genotype1	Genotype2	Genotype3WT 17	Het 34	Mut 222	1	414	3	1118	5	1224	6	1328	8	2029	10	2130	15	2354	19	2758	22	3561	33	3968	36	4675	38	5676	40	6078	43	6480	44	6686	47	6796	49	69	51	87	52	89	53	92	55	79	57	81	59		62		65		71		72		73		74		77		88	90	93	95
